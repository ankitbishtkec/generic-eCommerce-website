<p style="font-size:120%;" >Our mission is to make it easier for you to order your meal/tiffin delivery in best price from highly rated restaurants/tiffin services/home chefs that don’t typically offer delivery service. </p>

<p style="font-size:120%" >Your choices are often limited to greasy pizza, dry noodles or watery curry in office pantry or going out which is too costly for everyday. Eating same tiffin or in same mess everyday is also boring. So we decided to fix it! </p>

<p style="font-size:120%" >Now you can! We’ve built an online ordering and fulfilment platform that allows you to order your meal/tiffin from multiple restaurants/tiffin services/home chefs on daily basis which will be delivered to your door by our trained superheroes within minutes of you placing the order. </p>

<p style="font-size:120%" >Easy?  Yes, for you! We worked really hard to seamlessly connect restaurants/tiffin services/home chefs with our network of smartly dressed food delivery guys via location-based courier app (if the tech-speak makes you yawn, you can order food instead). </p>

<p style="font-size:120%" >By combining technology with customer service and trained fleet of superheroes, we offer a robust delivery solution for restaurants/tiffin services/home chefs so they don’t have to become web marketers or courier fleet managers. With few clicks (or taps on our mobile app), you get great food from your favourite restaurant/tiffin service/home chef whenever and wherever you want it. </p>

<p style="font-size:120%;color:red" ><i>This is just the tip of iceberg. We have lots of features and processes in pipeline which will change the way you order food and eat it. And, we are working on those. </i></p>
